# PokeRoll-FAQ

### Evade / Clash and Multiple Actions

If you score the same or more successes as the foe's accuracy roll you evade. doesn't matter if it is your first, second, third, fourth or fifth action.

Pokemon **A** attacks Pokemon **B** with 5 successes, Pokemon **B** evades as their 3rd action, Pokemon **B** needs 5 successes, not 7.

Pokemon **A** attacks on their 3rd action with 5 successes, Pokemon **B** needs 5 successes, not 3.

Pokemon **A** attacks Pokemon **B** with 2 successes, Pokemon **B** evades as their 3rd action, Pokemon **B** needs 2 successes, not 5.

### Damage

The only way to reduce damage to 0 is with type resistance. otherwise is 1 damage.

### Mirror Move

You only roll accuracy once, you dont roll for the copied move.

### Bide

Unlike the games you can actually do stuff while Bide is active (attack, evade, clash, ect). Damage is not stored if you clash. When unleashing Bide the foe clashes/evades agaist the accuracy roll that activated the move.

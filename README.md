# PokeRoll-FAQ

### Evade / Clash and Multiple Actions

If you score the same or more successes as the foe's accuracy roll you evade. doesn't matter if it is your first, second, third, fourth or fifth action.

Pokemon **A** attacks Pokemon **B** with 5 successes, Pokemon **B** evades as their 3rd action, Pokemon **B** needs 5 successes, not 7.

Pokemon **A** attacks on their 3rd action with 5 successes, Pokemon **B** needs 5 successes, not 3.

### Damage

The only way to reduce damage to 0 is with type resistance. otherwise is 1 damage.

### Clashing for an ally

If an attack is targetting an ally you can clash it. if you fail you lose an action an the ally gets hit as normal, you are the one that takes the Clash damage if you succeed.

### Mirror Move

You only roll accuracy once, you dont roll for the copied move.

### Bide

Unlike the games you can actually do stuff while Bide is active (attack, evade, clash, ect). Damage is not stored if you clash. When unleashing Bide the foe clashes/evades agaist the accuracy roll that activated the move.

### Damage reduction moves

Similarly to Attribute buffs, moves that reduce damage do not stack.

eg if you use Light Screen and then Aurora Veil you do not get -2 damage from Special Attacks, only -1.
